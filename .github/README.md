# md2apkg-run-demo

This code gives a much more detailed demonstration of what [`md2apkg-run`](https://github.com/asa55/md2apkg-run) can do. If you're new here, I recommend chacking that project out before digging into this demo code.

The quickstart instructions will tell you how to build the contents of `md2apkg-run-demo` into an Anki-compatible `.apkg` flashcard deck.

Give it a try, pull it into Anki, and compare the flashcard deck you see there to the `.md` files you see in this repo.

If you decide to use `md2apkg-run` to make your own flashcard decks, this demo should give you a great overview of how to implement every available feature.

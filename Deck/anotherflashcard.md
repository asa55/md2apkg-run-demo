## A standalone flashcard, but tagged

<!-- md2apkg tags oneTag anotherTag -->

I said tags won't be applied underneath `Deck/`, which is true by default, but you can define your own custom tags on any flashcard, using the syntax above.

This flashcard will be tagged `oneTag` and `anotherTag`. If I defined this flashcard in subfolders beneath `Deck/`, this flashcard would get the tags I defined here, plus whatever additional tags that `md2apkg-run` applies based on the directory names you've defined.

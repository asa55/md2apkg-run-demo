## Flashcard with "tag-B"

This flashcard is tagged based on the directory path `Deck/tagA/tag-B`. It will get tagged with `tagA`, and `tagA::tag-B` (note that spaces in folder names is incompatible with the auto-tagging feature of `md2apkg-run`.

%

Instead of spaces, I recommend using `camelCase`, or `PascalCase`, or `kebab-case`, or `snake_case` for your folder names)

## Flashcard with "tag-B"

<!-- md2apkg tags oneTag -->

This flashcard is tagged based on the directory path `Deck/tagA/tag-B`. It will get tagged with `tagA`, and `tagA::tag-B` (note that spaces in folder names is incompatible with the auto-tagging feature of `md2apkg-run`. Instead of spaces, I recommend using `camelCase`, or `PascalCase`, or `kebab-case`, or `snake_case` for your folder names)

Also note I applied a custom tag to this flashcard, which is shared with one of the tags applied to a flashcard defined in `Deck/anotherflashcard.md`.  If you convert this demo code and open this deck in Anki, then filter based on the `oneTag` tag, this flashcard and the other will show up for you.

This demonstrates some of the flexibility you have with tags, in combination with the auto-tagging feature applied by `md2apkg-run`.

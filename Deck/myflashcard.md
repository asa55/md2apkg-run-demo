## A standalone flashcard

This flashcard is adjacent to `index.md`, directly underneath `Deck/`. This flashcard will be appended to the contents of `index.md` automatically.

But flashcards defined in this file as well as those defined in `index.md` will *not* have any tags applied.

If you want tags applied to all of your flashcards, I'd recommend using `index.md` to define the name of your deck, and nothing else. Then create subfolders (to define your tags), and define flashcard `.md` files inside of those.
